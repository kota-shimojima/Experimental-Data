Emulating a raw syscall instruction. This degrades performance, consider patching your application to use Gramine syscall API.
Running problem size 80^3 per domain until completion
Num processors: 1
Num threads: 12
Total number of elements: 512000 

To run other sizes, use -s <integer>.
To run a fixed number of iterations, use -i <integer>.
To run a more or less balanced region set, use -b <integer>.
To change the relative costs of regions, use -c <integer>.
To print out progress, use -p
To write an output file for VisIt, use -v
See help (-h) for more options
